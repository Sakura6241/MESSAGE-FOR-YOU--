        Happy monthsary! Thank you for filling my life with love and happiness üíå
      </div>
      <div class="second-text"> 
         Kamusta ka dyan...? wag kang mag-alala sakin rito, okay lang ako... Actually, medyo hindi.. pero okay lang naman common problems lang.
      </div>
      <div class="third-text"> 
        Every time this day comes, I can't help but think about how lucky I am to have you  ‚Äî and how much I wish I could be with you right now.
        </div>
      <div class="fourth-text">
       Sometimes it breaks my heart that I can't hold your hand, hug you when you're sad,  or look into your eyes while I say ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù
      </div>
      <div class="fifth-text">
        Distance has been our greatest challenge, but it's also the reason I love you even more ‚Äî because despite the miles, we keep choosing each other every single day.
      </div>
       <div class="six-text">
        There are nights when I lie awake, missing you so much it hurts.
       </div>
       <div class="seven-text">
        I imagine how it would feel to finally fall asleep beside you,  to hear your laughter in person, to wipe away your tears with my own hands.
      </div>
      <div class="eight-text">
        And while it makes me ache inside knowing I can't do those things yet,  it also reminds me of how powerful our love is ‚Äî strong enough to survive even when we're apart.
      </div>
      <div class="nine-text">
        Some days, I handle the distance fine. But on days like this, it hurts more than usual.
      </div>
      <div class="ten-text">
        It hurts knowing that I can't kiss your forehead, can't hug you when I want to, can't see your smile in person.
      </div>
      <div class="eleven-text">
        I hate that we have to love each other through screens, and that every ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù after feels like a little crack in my chest.
      </div>
      <div class="twelve-text">
        People say love is supposed to make you happy ‚Äî and it does ‚Äî but they don't talk enough about how much it can ache when the person you love is miles away.
      </div>
      <div class="Thirteen-text"> 
        I won't lie, there are nights when I cry quietly, just missing you.  
      </div>
      <div class="fourteen-text">
        Nights when I wish the distance would magically disappear, even for just a day, so I could finally feel the comfort of your presence.
      </div>
      <div class="fifthteen-text">
        I imagine us sitting together, stroking your hair in silence, and even that thought makes my heart ache, because silence with you would still feel like home.
      </div>
      <div class="six-teen-text">
        There are nights when the silence around me is unbearable.
      </div>
      <div class="seven-teen-text">
        I close my eyes and imagine you here, your head resting on my shoulder, your laughter filling the emptiness.
      </div>
      <div class="eight-teen-text">
        But then I open them, and the reality sinks in ‚Äî I'm alone, and you're still far away.
      </div>
      <div class="nine-teen-text">
        That's the hardest part about loving you like this‚Ä¶
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-text">
        knowing you exist, knowing you're mine, yet not being able to reach you when I need you most.
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-one-text">
        But even in this sadness, I would still choose you.
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-two-text">
        I would still choose the ache of missing you over the emptiness of not loving you at all.
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-three-text">
        Because even from afar, you've given me more happiness than I ever thought I could deserve.
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-four-text">
        The truth is, love, I feel so empty without you. Every day I put on a smile, but when I'm alone, the silence eats me alive.
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-five-text">
        Every night I lie in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering how much longer I can keep doing this without you here.
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-six-text">
        I don't really have anyone I can talk to. I am telling the truth. I keep everything inside because no one would understand ‚Äî no one but you.
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-seven-text">
        And it kills me that the one person who knows me best, the one person who makes me feel safe, isn't here when I need you the most.
      </div>
      <div class="twenty-eight-text">
        I feel so alone in this world, like I'm screaming inside but no one can hear me.
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-one-text">
        You're the only one who makes me feel seen, the only one who makes this loneliness fade. even just a little.
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-one-text-one">
        You make my world brighter just by existing. Every message from you, every laugh we share, even from afar, makes me feel alive in ways nothing else can.
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-one-text-three">
        Not everyone can do what we're doing, not everyone can fight through the miles and the loneliness, but we are ‚Äî and that makes me proud of us.
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-one-text-three-four">
        I know the best days are still ahead of us. I can already picture the smiles we'll share, the adventures we'll take, and the simple quiet moments that will mean the most.
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-one-text-three-five">
        Being with you has taught me that love doesn't need to be perfect ‚Äî it just needs to be true.
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-two-text">
        Happy monthsary, my love. It hurts so much to celebrate this day without you beside me.
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-four-text">
        But I'm sure One day, this silence will end, and when I finally have you in my arms, I'll never feel alone again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-five-text">
        I'll keep waiting, keep hurting, keep loving, until the day you're finally here with me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
      </div>
      <div class="thirty-six-text">
       I love you endlessly, even in sadness, even in distance, even in silence. Always. Goodbyee- üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
      </div>
